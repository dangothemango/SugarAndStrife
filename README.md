# Sugar and Strife

### The Tech
Sugar and Strife is a game created using the phaser.js engine. It was designed for the iPhone 6 but will run smoothly in any web browser with a resolution greater than or equal to that of said phone.

### The Concept
This game was made as the second assignment of Game Development 1 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The challenge was to create a mobile browser based game with the input limited to one finger touch based on a given phrase. In our case the phrase was **Horror at the candy factory**.

### Gameplay
Simply drag ingredients into the couldron to make candy that meets the requirements.

Hint: Every reaction has a counter reaction and order matters

And if you get really lost, theres a solutions file in the root directory of the repo
