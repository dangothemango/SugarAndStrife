Here's how I propose the flavor system works: sweet counters sour, sour counters spicy, spicy counters sweet. 
Nutty and bitter counter each other.


Sugar
--sweet

Salt
--is salty

Corn Syrup

--sweet
--sticky

Milk
--lactic
--dulls spice

Stevia
--VERY sweet
--Isn’t sugar

Cinnamon
--spicy

Cocoa
--is bitter

Gelatin
--makes candy sticky but not sweet

Almond Extract
--tastes like nuts
--aggravates nut allergies
--flavor is dissolved in an alcohol solution

Citric Acid
--is sour
--is acidic
Mint
--smells and tastes cool
--is NOT mutually exclusive with spicy

Food coloring
--any color
--no flavor



<Weird ingredients>

Eldritch Ichor
--Vile blood of an Old God
--tastes vile, requires a strong taste to mask
--causes horrific things to happen to the eater

Nitroglycerin
--as an organic compound, it tastes like burning (VERY spicy)
--explosive

Mind-Controleum
--Makes the eater suggestible
--reacts badly to alcohol (it decomposes completely)
--no flavor 



Cyanide
--kills the eater pretty instantly
--smells like nuts, can be masked

Antimony
--kills the eater slowly (Choice between killing mark “fast” or “slow” is determined by clients, fast is better for assassinations, slow is better for inheritances)
--strong metallic flavor, must be masked

Flavor Negative
--converts sweetness to spicy, spicy to sour, and sour to sweet
--reacts badly with dye BUT, not if dye is added afterward
--organic fluids like Nitro and milk are neutralized

Aqua Regia
--is red
--is voraciously acidic (disintegrates eater)
--is far too sour to eat without some sort of mask
--is neutralized by milk unless Flavor Negative is added beforehand

Tranquilizer
--is blue
--puts target to sleep because the flavor is so dull
--is mutually exclusive to spicy

Bleach
--neutralizes colors (candy is invisible unless dye is added later)
--toxic, but impractical for poisoning
--bitter (countered by nut flavor)

“Screaming”
--causes the eater to go violently insane
--Candy must be hard and unsticky
--requires a strong flavor that isn’t sour in order to function


Snake Venom
--neutralizes poisons
--forms cyanide when mixed with super glue

Super Glue
--glues the victim’s mouth shut
--makes candy sticky as a side effect
--is toxic, but impractical for poisoning
