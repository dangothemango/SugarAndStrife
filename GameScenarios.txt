Scenario 1 (Inheritance):

* Opening:
   * “I hear you’re the person to see if I want someone “taken care of”. Your methods are quiet and effective, that sounds pretty sweet to me because that’s what I need. You see, my grandfather has yet to...pass on and until then his assets are inaccessible. It’d be a real shame if something were to...happen to him, if you catch my meaning.”
* Closing:
   * “Congratulations. The kill was quiet and subtle. No one expected the candy to be the reason he died, so that’s good. Nothing can be traced back to me. Job well done.”
* Objectives:
   * Brown
   * 50% Salty
   * 10% Bitter
   * Cyanide

Scenario 2 (Professional Demise):

* Opening: 
   * “Hi, um...so I don’t really. Um, let me start over. Okay. My friend said you could make people...go away? Well, not go away, I mean die. Yes, die. That’s...that’s what I want. I want my boss to die! He's got this explosive temper and I just...I can’t take it anymore! He’s making my life a living hell and he’s keeping me from getting a promotion! So can you just...Can you just, make him go away, for good?”
* Closing:
   * “Thank God he’s gone. I don’t know how you managed it, but he’s gone. Finally! He was an asshole and now he can’t bully me anymore. Doesn’t hurt I also got his job, not that that’s what I wanted. I swear. It just, happened. But thank you and, and to show my appreciation and that I didn’t do this for a promotion, you can have my pay bonus.”
* Objectives:
   * Red
   * 75% Spicy
   * Explosive

Scenario 3 (Slippery Slope):

* Opening:
   * “My girlfriend broke up with me and she took the dog. She called me “immature” and a “jerk”. Well I’ll show her! I want you to teach her a lesson for dumping me. She’ll see that I’m the best she’s going to get. She’s not even that pretty! Here’s the money upfront. I don’t care what you do, just hurt her somehow.”
* Closing:
   * “Apparently she sprouted tentacles before she died and no one knows why. Most people are whispering that the government had something to do with it. I didn’t want this to happen. I...I just need a moment. I need to rethink what I’m doing with my life. I didn’t want her to die…”
* Objectives:
   * Blue
   * 50% Bitter
   * 50% Salty
   * Tentacles

Scenario 4 (All Hail Slime):

* Opening:
   * “Rumor has it you’re the person to see to make weird things happen to people. Apparently you made some poor woman sprout tentacles and that’s along the lines of what I’m looking for. I want to convert my cult into slime monsters. I’m not sure just how to go about it, but that’s your job. They don’t know that this is going to happen, but I’m their God, so they won’t mind. It’s not like I’m asking them to wear spaghetti strainers on their heads.”
* Closing:
   * “My dreams of leading a slime monster cult has come true and I can’t be happier! Now we have to plan out how to overtake the outside world and the nonbelievers. But we’ll spare you since you’re the one who allowed us to rise to a new level of being.”
* Objectives:
   * Green
   * 15% Umami
   * Slime

Scenario 5 (In Pear We Trust):

* Opening:
   * “I may be the CEO of Pear Products, but I’m not here to sell you on anything. That’s just not what I’m about. But I do need your help. I’m here to hire you to become somewhat of a...business associate. You’ll do what you do best and cook up something that’ll...persuade the minds of consumers on buying the new and improved pear phone. Sales are down and we just won’t settle for failure. This shouldn't be too hard for someone who has managed to gain the attention of Pear Products.”
* Closing:
   * “It didn’t take long for people to start lining up outside my stores. I swear I saw some drool falling out of their mouths. But I’m sure the world won’t mind a few hundred thousand mindless zombies. My innovative phones are a household name and I suppose paying you out properly would be only fair.”
* Objectives:
   * Purple
   * 30% Sweet
   * 25% Umami
   * Mind Control

Scenario 6 (United We Implode):

* Opening: 
   * “I represent a group that would prefer to go nameless and I don’t want to beat around the bush. What we need are some candies that’ll make someone implode, much like the world is imploding on itself. But that’s beside the fact. I imagine you can do the job, no questions asked. That’s why I’m here, otherwise I’d find someone else to do business with. So you’ve got my order, the sooner it’s finished the better. We’re on a strict timeframe.”
* Closing: 
   * “Well, you did it. You managed to make a candy that made the heads of every world leader implode. I can’t say I could have ever imagined something like it possible. And I’m sure you might not have expected that either. Regardless, you are a hero of our cause and you’ll be remembered, for as long as anyone remembers anything in a world run by anarchy.”
* Objectives:
   * Yellow
   * 100% Sour
   * Implosion
