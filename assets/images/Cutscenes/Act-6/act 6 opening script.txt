6_1_1: Title card
6_1_2: I represent a group that would prefer to go nameless and I don’t want to beat around the bush. 
6_1_3: What we need are some candies that’ll make someone implode, much like the world is imploding on itself. 
6_1_4: But that’s beside the fact. I'm certain you can do the job, no questions asked. 

6_1_5: That’s why I’m here, otherwise I’d find someone else to do business with. So you’ve got my order, the sooner it’s finished the better. We’re on a strict timeframe.
